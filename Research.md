### Working Papers:
#### Measuring Manufacturing and Process Innovation, Application to Productivity and Growth *(Under Review)*
*(with Elvira Sojli and Wing Wah Tham)*

We propose new time-varying measures of advanced manufacturing and process innovations based on patent invention claims and titles from 1850 to 2019 across 51 countries. Using this measure, we provide evidence that these innovations are important for firm and aggregate economic growth through technological spillover to product innovations and increased profitability. We find that patents with advanced processes have higher forward citations and economic value than product patents of the same technology class and cohort. Firms with higher quality process innovation are associated with higher profits, sales, capital, employment, and total factor productivity in the short run, while product innovation plays a larger role in the longer run. At the aggregate level, both advanced manufacturing and product innovations are positively related to US economic growth. In cross-country analysis, we find that product innovation is more important than process innovation for emerging countries with low labor costs for growth convergence towards the US economy, but the opposite holds for productivity.

#### Is ESG a Management Style? *(under review)*
*(with Tony Cai, Jason Zein and Hao Zhang)*

Can better firm ESG policies be attributed to a CEO’s style? We find that firms led by CEOs with not-for-profit sector work experience (socially engaged CEOs) possess better ESG ratings and superior real ESG outcomes. They receive higher satisfaction ratings from their employees, develop more green innovations, and have lower harmful emissions. Mirroring the rise of ESG, the proportion of socially engaged CEOs has increased four-fold over the last 20 years. While corporate boards appear to be increasingly selecting these CEOs to enhance their ESG performance, we show that these effects can, to some extent, also be attributed to a causal CEO style. Overall, our results suggest that career experience serving the interests of a broader group of stakeholders in the not-for-profit setting better equips CEOs to achieve corporate ESG objectives

#### CEO Experience and Value Creation: Evidence from Green Lab Locations

Green technologies are imperative for green growth. We show that CEOs with more agglomeration experience are critical for opening green R\&D labs that exploit potential productivity and agglomeration benefits. Using exogenous shocks to non-focal green inventor mobility surrounding a focal firm's research labs, we find that the concentration of cutting-edge green inventors improves the focal firm’s green innovation quality. Using CEO$\times$firm fixed effects, we identify a significant impact of CEOs' time-varying experience in agglomeration economies on lab location and innovation success through knowledge spillovers and better inventor-firm matching. Our findings suggest that insiders are key to the firm’s green innovation success.

#### Common Ownership and Antitrust Enforcement: Evidence from the Court 
*(with Huaizhou Li, Ronald Masulis and Jason Zein)*

An increasing number of publicly-owned rival firms are jointly held by a small group of large investors. This has led to serious concerns regarding the anti-competitive effects of such common ownership. We investigate U.S. antitrust legal cases to see if common ownership leads to serious antitrust concerns. We empirically show that there is a significant positive relationship between common ownership and the probability that a pair of firms face the same antitrust prosecution. We use mergers between financial institutions as exogenous variations in common ownership to provide causal evidence on this proposed relation. In addition, we find that existing level of antitrust enforcement is unlikely to deter the anti-competitive effect of common ownership.
