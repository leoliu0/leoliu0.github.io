*(R&R MS)*

*(with Elvira Sojli and Wing Wah Tham)*


Green technologies are imperative for green growth. We show that CEOs with more agglomeration experience are critical for opening green R\&D labs that exploit potential productivity and agglomeration benefits. Using exogenous shocks to non-focal green inventor mobility surrounding a focal firm's research labs, we find that the concentration of cutting-edge green inventors improves the focal firm’s green innovation quality. Using CEO$\times$firm fixed effects, we identify a significant impact of CEOs' time-varying experience in agglomeration economies on lab location and innovation success through knowledge spillovers and better inventor-firm matching. Our findings suggest that insiders are key to the firm’s green innovation success.

#### Common Ownership and Antitrust Enforcement: Evidence from the Court 
*(with Huaizhou Li, Ronald Masulis and Jason Zein)*

<!-- An increasing number of publicly-owned rival firms are jointly held by a small group of large investors. This has led to serious concerns regarding the anti-competitive effects of such common ownership. We investigate U.S. antitrust legal cases to see if common ownership leads to serious antitrust concerns. We empirically show that there is a significant positive relationship between common ownership and the probability that a pair of firms face the same antitrust prosecution. We use mergers between financial institutions as exogenous variations in common ownership to provide causal evidence on this proposed relation. In addition, we find that existing level of antitrust enforcement is unlikely to deter the anti-competitive effect of common ownership. -->
