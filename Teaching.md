Student Feedback Highlights:

- Nice and patient
- very clear and practical
- Strong ability and affinity
- Best lecturer I've ever encountered during my study in UNSW. Lectures are very interesting and delivered in a clear and easy to understand way, and the lecturer makes the topic interesting to study. He is also very understanding to his students and always response to students' questions. His teaching strategies are also highly effective, with the weekly homework and quizzes that are highly relevant to the course materials and deepens our understanding of the topics. Will enroll in his other courses if I can.
- Very attentive and encouraging students.
- Leo is the best lecturer that I have ever seen so for at UNSW. He is able to explain complicated and difficult materials into a very simple and easy–understanding way. I have attended his MFIN6201 in term 1 and because of this my friends and I chose the modules that he teaches this term. Keep going Leo, we believe you will be one of the most successful professor in UNSW. :)
