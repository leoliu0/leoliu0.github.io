Leo is an early career fellow at the UNSW Business School. My main research interests are innovation, entrepreneurship and organization studies. I am interested in measuring innovation and studying how innovation affects firm value, economic growth and productivity. I am also interested in how CEO characteristics, ability and skills lead to different firm policies and outcomes. In addition, I apply advanced statistical and machine learning techniques in applied finance, economics and management studies.
